# Point map

Generate a mapping that looks like this:

    lat,lon,nghd,tract,block_group,block
    40.242,-80.2,Outside Allegheny,Outside Pittsburgh,Outside Pittsburgh,Outside Pittsburgh
    40.242,-80.199,Outside Allegheny,Outside Pittsburgh,Outside Pittsburgh,Outside Pittsburgh
    40.242,-80.198,Outside Allegheny,Outside Pittsburgh,Outside Pittsburgh,Outside Pittsburgh
    40.242,-80.197,Outside Allegheny,Outside Pittsburgh,Outside Pittsburgh,Outside Pittsburgh

(but for san francisco)
this is to help make it easier to classify a point into a neighborhood (somewhat imperfectly)
